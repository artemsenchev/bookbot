# Book Bot: A Python Novel Analyzer

## Overview
This repository contains **Book Bot**, a Python program designed to analyze novels and generate statistical reports on word and character usage. This project is part of the Python course offered by [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev), focusing on building a complete Python application from scratch while adhering to professional development practices.

Although this is my first Python project on Boot.dev, I have over 10 years of self-taught experience in Python programming. This project serves as an opportunity to refine my skills and consolidate best practices for professional development workflows.
